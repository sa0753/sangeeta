I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.</div>\n",

Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of \"pernicious violence\" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever \"deserved\" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.</div>\n",

Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director</div>\n",

We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.<br/><br/>Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.<br/><br/>It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\n",
            "It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.<br/><br/>Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).<br/><br/>I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.</div>\n",

This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.</div>\n",

The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.<br/><br/>If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\n",
            "What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.<br/><br/>\n",
            "Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\n",
            "Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.<br/><br/>\n",
            "In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.</div>\n",

To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Until now, the only review of this movie that I 100% agree with is the review from The Times. I stole the title of this review because it just hits the nail on the head.<br/><br/>In the first impulse, I didn't even want to watch this movie, because I'm just fed up with the Joker. DC has many, much more interesting villains than Joker. It's time to tell stories about them and not constantly repeat the Joker's story, where there is no chance to say anything new, because in fact the Joker is not an interesting story at all. A rejected, angry man, who fails in life, a clown who becomes a killer - history as old as the world.<br/><br/>Everything that could be said about Joker, said Nolan in the Dark Knight, plus various comics and yes - Batman and Joker cartoons too. Nolan also told the Joker story more subtly than this movie, not only by the whole story structure, but also excellent dialogues, Nolan's dialogues are simply in their own league. People who, I already see, claim in the reviews, that it is this film, that fully reflects the depth of the Joker character, or that it is such a successful '' artistic '' film - they simply try to cast a spell on reality, giving the film a meaning that doesn't exist .<br/><br/>I know what Phoenix tried to do here - he chose the form of 'performance' as acting, that is, there is performance in the performance. The depth was supposed to be inside, between the lines, but unfortunately the effect is quite different - the whole film, like this role, is a Russian babushka: empty inside, you can open subsequent layers and there is nothing, no message, there is just another empty doll, which in the movie is just another empty, technical exercise in acting and filmmaking.<br/><br/>I will quote the Times review again, because it is excellent at exposing the shallowness and pseudo-artistic nature of this film : ''Joker - which was written by Phillips and Scott Silver - doesn't have a plot; it's more like a bunch of reaction GIFs strung together. When Arthur gets fired from his clown job, he struts by the time-clock, deadpans, \"Oh no, I forgot to punch out\" and then, wait for it, socks it so hard it dangles from the wall. Make a note of the moment, because you'll be seeing it a lot in your Twitter and Facebook feeds.<br/><br/>The movie's cracks - and it's practically all cracks - are stuffed with phony philosophy. Joker is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it's imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more violent tirades, Arthur muses, \"Everybody just screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore.\" Who doesn't feel that way in our terrible modern times? But Arthur's observation is one of those truisms that's so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing.''<br/><br/>I could leave it here, but I'll add one more thing : what was great about Nolan was that Nolan was able to combine the features of commercial, mainstream and independent film in one and what he said was authentic. This accusation, which Nolan haters often repeat - that Nolan is pretentious is not true, especially in Dark Knight trilogy (because I can agree that Inception is terribly pretentious). In TDK Nolan doesn't arrogantly run away from mainstream, because he fully understood what it takes to make epic, successful superhero movie, but at the same time, he added depth to this story, by exploring both the dark and the humanistic side of Wayne / Batman's soul. And revolutionized the genre.<br/><br/>Whereas Joker by Todd Philiphs is the quintessence of pretentiousness and fakeness. There is nothing authentic in this movie. It is a collection of cheap fanfiction, quotes from movies like Taxi Driver, poured with sauce of pop culture tricks. Phoenix battered body twists and turns on the screen, but there is no soul in this creation. This role is empty, just like the whole movie. Time to say goodbye to Joker, DC. You have much better villains in your stable, whose story can be fascinating to tell. The Joker ceased to be interesting long time ago. Btw, Batman has always been a more interesting character to me, because although he is a superhero, he is also the only such a popular superhero, who has so much darkness, killer impulse, but also humanity from his father, inside of him (and Bale showed all of this masterfully in Nolan trilogy). The ambivalence is fascinating here. The Joker is a wounded clown, nihilist, murderer. This story is told in the cinema several times a year. There is nothing fresh or interesting about it.</div>\n",

The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe.

Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.<br/><br/>I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters.

I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker.

            "i have seen joker yesterday at venice an early ill-fated screening. we had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.joker deserved to be presented at venice film festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.it focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. and thus, joaquin phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\n",
            "it's a take on the joker that differs from ledger's, but i'd say that both are equally as good. the main difference might be that ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while phoenix's is insane to the root.despite being a movie about a superhero villain, joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (i'd exclude the dark knight trilogy only, but joker is easily as good as nolan's movies, or at least very close). it is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to scorsese's 'taxi driver' and his 'the king of comedy', but also chaplin's 'modern times' is somewhat referenced).i am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by todd phillips. this movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by dolor y gloria or once upon a time in hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\n",

            "this movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the joker. the joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. i think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. it is important to know when to sympathize with the joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). this movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. it isn't for light amusement. that substance is what makes it so good.if you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.\n",

            "there is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. i must praise phoenix's superb acting. he managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. i really think it's a role only few could do. it was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.but...there wasn't anything too complex about arthur's mental state. no deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. could it be that i was expecting too much? very possible since i came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\n",
            "what doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original joker. he felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. he didn't have the master mind that so much designated the joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\n",
            "another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\n",
            "also i found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the joker played in them. even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\n",
            "in conclusion, i can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. but as a movie about the joker i felt it was lacking. lacking the things that made the joker actually the joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\n",

            "until now, the only review of this movie that i 100% agree with is the review from the times. i stole the title of this review because it just hits the nail on the head.in the first impulse, i didn't even want to watch this movie, because i'm just fed up with the joker. dc has many, much more interesting villains than joker. it's time to tell stories about them and not constantly repeat the joker's story, where there is no chance to say anything new, because in fact the joker is not an interesting story at all. a rejected, angry man, who fails in life, a clown who becomes a killer - history as old as the world.everything that could be said about joker, said nolan in the dark knight, plus various comics and yes - batman and joker cartoons too. nolan also told the joker story more subtly than this movie, not only by the whole story structure, but also excellent dialogues, nolan's dialogues are simply in their own league. people who, i already see, claim in the reviews, that it is this film, that fully reflects the depth of the joker character, or that it is such a successful '' artistic '' film - they simply try to cast a spell on reality, giving the film a meaning that doesn't exist .i know what phoenix tried to do here - he chose the form of 'performance' as acting, that is, there is performance in the performance. the depth was supposed to be inside, between the lines, but unfortunately the effect is quite different - the whole film, like this role, is a russian babushka: empty inside, you can open subsequent layers and there is nothing, no message, there is just another empty doll, which in the movie is just another empty, technical exercise in acting and filmmaking.i will quote the times review again, because it is excellent at exposing the shallowness and pseudo-artistic nature of this film : ''joker - which was written by phillips and scott silver - doesn't have a plot; it's more like a bunch of reaction gifs strung together. when arthur gets fired from his clown job, he struts by the time-clock, deadpans, \"oh no, i forgot to punch out\" and then, wait for it, socks it so hard it dangles from the wall. make a note of the moment, because you'll be seeing it a lot in your twitter and facebook feeds.the movie's cracks - and it's practically all cracks - are stuffed with phony philosophy. joker is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it's imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. just before one of his more violent tirades, arthur muses, \"everybody just screams at each other. nobody's civil anymore.\" who doesn't feel that way in our terrible modern times? but arthur's observation is one of those truisms that's so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. it means nothing.''i could leave it here, but i'll add one more thing : what was great about nolan was that nolan was able to combine the features of commercial, mainstream and independent film in one and what he said was authentic. this accusation, which nolan haters often repeat - that nolan is pretentious is not true, especially in dark knight trilogy (because i can agree that inception is terribly pretentious). in tdk nolan doesn't arrogantly run away from mainstream, because he fully understood what it takes to make epic, successful superhero movie, but at the same time, he added depth to this story, by exploring both the dark and the humanistic side of wayne / batman's soul. and revolutionized the genre.whereas joker by todd philiphs is the quintessence of pretentiousness and fakeness. there is nothing authentic in this movie. it is a collection of cheap fanfiction, quotes from movies like taxi driver, poured with sauce of pop culture tricks. phoenix battered body twists and turns on the screen, but there is no soul in this creation. this role is empty, just like the whole movie. time to say goodbye to joker, dc. you have much better villains in your stable, whose story can be fascinating to tell. the joker ceased to be interesting long time ago. btw, batman has always been a more interesting character to me, because although he is a superhero, he is also the only such a popular superhero, who has so much darkness, killer impulse, but also humanity from his father, inside of him (and bale showed all of this masterfully in nolan trilogy). the ambivalence is fascinating here. the joker is a wounded clown, nihilist, murderer. this story is told in the cinema several times a year. there is nothing fresh or interesting about it.\n",

            "joaquin phoenix is the joker. phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of heath ledger's joker, jack nicholson's joker, and alex in a clockwork orange:overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. the acting and plot are what sold it though. phoenix made me forget that the character was one i had seen before in other movies. his performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like i too had just taken a descent into madness.i've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so i was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. i loved this movie and will definitely see it again. it was just what i hoped it would be.\n",

            "i thought this film was good but i just don't get the hype personally. the acting was amazing and the film was good overall but i think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. in no way did i dislike this film, i thought it was really good, just overhyped. i feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. if this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, i don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\n",
